# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)!

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding competition that runs every December. Each day, a new problem is released, challenging participants to solve puzzles using programming. Itâ€™s a fantastic way to improve problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, and have fun during the holiday season.

## Structure of the Repository
This repository contains solutions for each day's puzzles. Each problem is typically divided into two parts, and solutions may be written in various programming languages. The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
|-- Day01/
|   |-- part1.py
|   |-- part2.py
|
|-- Day02/
|   |-- part1.py
|   |-- part2.py
|
...
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-2024.git
